Description: Having a Developer Group in JSS would help bring up the IT skillset of our students to a newer height and bring them to terms with all things happening in and around Google and Open Source.
The student learning process will be very intuitive and exciting when it comes to all GDG events. The students will take back a rich technical experiences and awareness without being bogged down by long theoretical sessions.
The way GDG comes into the scene is that it plans for events that are concise but technically enriching.
